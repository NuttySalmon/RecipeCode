- 1 kg of yeast 
- 84 kg of nuts 
- 70 kg of berries
- 30 kg of cheese
- 15 kg of herbs
- 40 g of salt 

Directions:
1. If water is more than flour, weight nuts, otherwise weight berries. (print char, expected 'F')
2. Weight starter. (print new line char)
3. If water is more than or equal to flour and yeast is done, weight nuts, otherwise weight berries. (print char, expected 'F')
4. Weight starter. (print new line char)
5. Bake yeast then check yeast. (increment)
6. Chill flour for 4 mins then check flour. (decrement)

(test loops)
7. While starter is not done, keep chilling starter then check starter.
8. Repeatedly bake starter then check starter until starter is as much as berries.

(test mixed typed addition and subtraction)
9. Remove starter and flour from yeast then check yeast. (int <= int - int - float)
10. Remove flour and starter from yeast then check yeast. (int <= int - float - int)
11. Remove yeast and starter from flour then check flour. (float <= float - int - int)
12. Remove starter and water from flour then check flour. (float <= float - int - float)
13. Add cheese and salt to cheese then check cheese. (int <= int + float + int)
14. Add salt and cheese to cheese then check cheese. (int <= float + int + int)
15. Add cheese and herbs to water then check water. (float <= int+int+float)
16. Add water and flour and cheese to salt then check salt. (float <= float+float+int+float)
