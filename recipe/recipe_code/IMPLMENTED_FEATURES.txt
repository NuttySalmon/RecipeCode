    	- <data declaration here>

Declaration and assignment:
    - 1 kg of pork (int pork  = 1)
    - 1 L of milk (int milk = 1)
    - 2.3 mL of water (float water = 2.3)
    - 3 g of salt (float salt = 3)

Addition: 
	Add water into flour. (flour = flour + water)
    Add water, salt and yeast into flour. (flour = flour + water + salt + yeast)

Subtraction:
    Remove banana from bowl. (bowl = bowl - banana)
    Remove banana, apple, and orange from bowl. (bowl = bowl - banana - apple - orange)

Multiplication:
	Mix water into flour. (flour = flour * water)
    Mix water, salt and yeast into flour. (flour = flour * water * salt * yeast)

Division:
	Divide pork into 4. (pork = pork / 4)
    Divide pork into size of meatball. (pork = pork / meatball)
    Divide pork into size of meatball and again into 3. (pork = pork / meatball / 3)

Increment:
    Bake bread. (bread = bread + 1)
    Bake bread for 4 mins. (bread = bread + 4)

Decrement:
    Chill mixture. (mixture = mixture - 1)
    Chill mixture for 4 mins. (mixture = mixture - 1)

Conditions:
    beef is as much as pork. (beef == pork)
    beef is not as much as pork. (beef != pork)
    beef is less than pork. (beef < pork)
    beef is less than or equal to pork. (beef <= pork)
    beef is done. (beef == 1)
    beef is not done. (beef != 1)
    beef is done and pork is less than flour (beef == 1 && pork < flour)
    beef is done or pork is more than flour  (beef == 1 || pork > flour)

If statement:
    If beef is not done, then cook beef. (IF beef != 1 THEN beef++)
    If beef less than pork, then divide pork into 2, otherwise divide beef into 5.
    (IF beef < pork THEN pork = pork/2 ELSE beef = beef/5)

While loop:
    While beef is not done, keep cooking beef. (WHILE beef != 1 THEN beef++)

Repeat until loop:
    Repeatedly cook beef until beef is done. (LOOP beef++ UNTIL beef == 1)

Print:
    Check beef. (print beef with new line)
    Weight beef. (treat int beef as ASCII value and print corresponding char)
